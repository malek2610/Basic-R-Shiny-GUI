# Basic R Shiny GUI

Shiny is an R package that makes it easy to build interactive web apps straight from R. You can host standalone apps on a webpage or embed them in R Markdown documents or build dashboards. You can also extend your Shiny apps with CSS themes, htmlwidgets, and JavaScript actions[<sup>1</sup>][ref_1].

Two configurations are possible, either using one single `app.R` file or multiple files ; `ui.R` and `server.R`
